Dog Breed Classification Project
Description
Who's a good dog? This project focuses on classifying dog breeds using deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify the breed of a dog from an image using a deep neural network. The dataset contains 120 different breeds, making this a fine-grained image classification problem. This work is based on a subset of the ImageNet dataset and involves training a model to distinguish between similar-looking breeds.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a subset of ImageNet, containing images of 120 dog breeds.
It includes a limited number of images per class, which adds to the challenge of the classification task.
Images are provided in high resolution, requiring preprocessing and augmentation for optimal model performance.
Model Overview
Model Architecture: MobileNet V2
Transfer Learning: The model is fine-tuned on the dog breed dataset starting from a pretrained MobileNet V2, which has been trained on the larger ImageNet dataset.
Why MobileNet V2?: It is a lightweight model with a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
Workflow
Data Preparation: Image preprocessing, augmentation, and batching.
Model Training: Fine-tuning the MobileNet V2 model with early stopping and tensorboard monitoring.
Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy on validation data and identifying performance metrics.
Prediction: Generating breed predictions with confidence scores for new images.
Visualization: Analyzing correct and incorrect predictions to improve the model.
